        (accessible from doctor search). For one doctor display profile information
(name, gender, work address(es), area(s) of specialization, and number of years licensed), the average
star rating, the number of reviews, as well as a list of links to the individual reviews in reverse
chronological order (i.e., most recent reviews on top). There should also be a link to write a new review.
