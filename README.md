##Patient-Doctor Review System

This system allows patients and doctors to both create accounts with their information and log in. Each patient can search for Doctors by a number of criteria (average rating, city, number of years licensed etc.) and view the respective doctor's profiles. Reviews can be added and viewed by the other patients which in turn affects a doctors average star rating.  Patients can also friend other patients and Doctors can view other Doctors' profiles with more available information.

JSP was used for the frontend while MYSQL was used for the backend. Java servlets interconnected the two.
